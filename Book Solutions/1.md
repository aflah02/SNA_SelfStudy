# Networks and Society

Objective Type

1) False (ig cos simple graph has no self loops but then there are some assumptions I'm making here like all entries are a 0 or 1 and not anything more as a simple graph does not have multiple edges)
2) (b) O(V^2) as I think about it like removing all pairs with the removed node or adding data for all existing nodes w.r.t. new node
3) (b) O(|V|+|E|) as one memory unit or so to say per entity so one per vertex and one per edge
4) True
5) True

Short Answer

1) No Clue
2) Health Workers are common links between COVID patients if they are a tad bit safer ig in some sense it makes the COVID and Non COVID patients a bit safer and also since they are critical for operations to continue making them safe protects them from collapsing which in some sense would collapse an entire subgraph if they fall ill
3) I'd say the best order seems 6->5->(2 or 3)->Remaining in Any Order, My rationale being 6 and 5 are clearly much more vulnerable and need to be vaccinated first then suppose 6 and 5 have been vaccinated the next logical step would be to find who's at risk 1 and 4 are now only acquainted with vaccinated people but 2 and 3 are acquainted with one another and are unvaccinated so vaccinating any one of them will ensure all the remaining are only acquainted with vaccinated people and the remaining then go in any order as it is immaterial from my perspective
4) If the motifs can be overlapping which I am not sure of then we have Star, Chain, Three-loop-out, Semi-Clique and Box. I can't spot a Clique
5) No it isn't unless researchers can time travel ;)
   
Long Answer
1) Pretty Standard
2) Pretty Standard
3) I guess it means that a bipartite can always be broken into 2 unipartite graphs
4) In author paper bipartite network authors are on one side and are linked to same papers if they have co authorship. We can use this information by connecting all authors of a paper to create a coauthorship network 
5) Reddit in general seems hard to model through one model as it has several facets from DMs to messages to communities, but how I would go about it is first make a set of nodes of all subreddits and the strength of edges between them is the number of crossposts between any 2 subreddits. I'd also like to have the graph to be directional as then it would showcase the flow of information and how a random message might originate and reach trending. Next a subreddit could infact be a subgraph in itself as say we have a sports subreddit it would itself have several competing groups in itself and so on. Another approach could be to create nodes from users clustered by similarity based on subreddits joined and edges being if they have talked via comments or not
6) Gephi installation issues :(
